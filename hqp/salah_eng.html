<span style="color: blue;">The person should make Niyah (intention), The intention is made within his mind, so the person should think about the particular obligatory, optional or Nafl prayer he intends to perform. He should not utter the words of Niyah aloud, as this is not authentic or approved by the Prophet(ﷺ).</span><br><br>


<h4>Hadith #15</h4><blockquote>
Narrated 'Umar bin Al-Khattab:<br>

It was narrated that 'Umar bin Al-Khattab(رضي الله عنه) said that <span style="color: blue;">“The Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) said:"Actions are but by intentions, and each man will have but that which he intended.”</span>
<cite>(Sunan Al Nasai Vol.4, Book 27, Hadith #3467)</cite></blockquote>

<p style="color:blue;">The Niyat to pray Salah, should be within one's heart or mind only. There is not a single Hadith or even an Athar (teaching of a sahabi) which shows that either the Prophet(ﷺ) or the best of Muslims to have ever lived - his companions (r.a.a) ever, in their entire life uttered their Niyat (to pray) VERBALLY in words (either loudly or softly). The sahabas went to different countries wherein they found people belonging to different caste, culture and languages  who came to them ( the companions r.a.a) to learn Islam (which included prayer). The sahabaas never taught anyone to make their niyat (intention) verbally in any language. So how can we do something which the Prophet(ﷺ) or his companions never did in Islam? We are neither better than them, nor are our scholars of today or past (All combined) better than them in understanding Islam,</p>

<h4>Hadith #18</h4><blockquote>
On the contrary the Prophet(ﷺ) said: <span style="color: blue;">“The key to prayer is purification; its beginning is Takbeer and its end is Tasleem” </span>
<cite>(Sunan Abu Dawood, 61, 618), (Al-Tirmidhee, 3, 238), (Ibn Maajah, 275, 276) on the authority of `Alee bin Abu Taalib, Abu Sa`eed al-Khudree رضي الله عنهما and graded as “Saheeh” by Shaikh al-Albaanee)</cite></blockquote>

<h4>Hadith #19</h4><blockquote>
And elsewhere the Prophet(ﷺ) said, in the hadeeth about the one who prayed badly: <span style="color: blue;">“Then turn towards the qiblah and say Allahu akbar.”<br>
<cite>(Narrated by Al-Bukhaari, #6667)</cite></blockquote>

<p style="color:blue;">Thus as we read , we see that the guidance (teaching) of the Prophet(ﷺ) in regards to one commencing his prayer is to face the Qiblah and say "Allahu-Akbar (takbeer)" . He (ﷺ) did not mention verbal utterance of niyah in arabic let alone in Hindi/Urdu/Bangla/etc. Hence this action of <span style="color: red;">doing a verbal niyat (either loudly or softly )</span>&nbsp;is not proven from the Prophet(ﷺ) or his companions and is an innovation (Bid'at) in Islam and there are numerous hadiths warning against any Innovation in Islam. Out of many, See The below :</p>

<table><tr style="font-weight:bold;">
<td style="border:2px solid red;">1</td>
<td style="border-top:2px solid red;border-bottom:2px solid red;">Innovates Something!!!</td>
</tr></table>

<h4>Hadith #20</h4><blockquote>
Narrated Aisha(رضي الله عنها): Allah's Apostle(ﷺ) said, <span style="color: blue;">“If somebody innovates something which is not in harmony (accordance) with the principles of our religion (Mine and my sahabas), that thing is rejected.”
<cite>(Sahih Bukhari, Vol. 3, Book 49, Hadith 861)</cite></blockquote>

<h4>Hadith #21</h4><blockquote>
On the Authority of Ali Ibn Abi Talib (رضي الله عنه) : The Prophet(ﷺ) said: <span style="color: blue;">“If anyone introduces an innovation, he will be responsible for it. If anyone introduces an innovation or gives shelter to a man who introduces an innovation (in religion), he is cursed by Allah, by His angels, and by all the people”</span><cite>(Sunan Abu Dawood, Book 39, Hadith 4515. This hadeeth is Da'eef but the matan is supported from different texts such as Abu-Dawud Book 036, Hadith Number 5221 and Sahih Muslim Book 7, Number 3159)</cite></blockquote>

<p style="color:blue;">So the act of verbally uttering one's niyat is not only religiously wrong but Also Illogical. e.g : You hear the Asr Adhan and you get up from your bed/office/room/work/desk etc and make wudhu, then you get out of the house, walk or ride towards the masjid. enter the masjid. and get ready to pray asr behind the Imam when the Iqama is heard. Now you did this only because you "INTENDED TO PRAY ASR" and not because "YOU WERE FAKING IT"</p>


<p style="color:blue;">So we learn that our Niyat has been already made logically. and We all know that Allah has been called by the word "Bizatis Sudoor" in the Quran which means "knower of the hearts". So Allah knows what we intend and what we don't. If a person intends to pray asr for the sake of Allah then Allah knows his niyat and if a person is standing to fake his prayer then no matter how good his verbal niyat is, Allah knows what is in his heart.</p>

<p style="color:blue;">Now we learn from above post's that Allah already knows what we are going to pray or how and etc. so now comes the Point that "if we pray only for the sake of Allah, and if Allah knows what we are going/intend to pray, and if we ourselves also know what we are going/intend to pray" then why are we reciting our niyat verbally? </p>

<p style="color:blue;">Then why to utter it verbally? This is illogical and one should abstain from this for this is a cursed innovation in Islam.</p>

<h4>Hadith #22</h4><blockquote>
Ibn Taymiyah(رضي الله عنه) said : <span style="color: blue;">“The intention (for the prayer) should not be uttered (verbally) according to the consensus (Ijmaa) of the Imams of Islaam. Rather the place of intention is the heart , according to the consensus among them”</span>
<cite>(Fataawa al-Kubra, 1/214,215)</cite></blockquote>

<span style="color: blue;">“Prophet(ﷺ) has given us permission to call out the Adhan and Iqamah even if we are travelling in a desert, or out on a mountain top whether we pray alone or with another person or with more no. of people.”</span><br>because of the evidence : <span style="color: blue;">“Sayyiduna Malik ibn al-Huwayrith (may Allah be pleased with him) says that two men came to the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him & give him peace), wanting to travel.

<p style="color:blue;">When we are praying Alone (if we miss the prayer in masjid due to some genuine reason) it is not neccessary for us to give the adhan or iqamah because that is a call for everyone to gather for prayer. however, if one wishes to give adhan and iqamah when he is praying alone then he may do so as there is permission for this.</p>

This [distinction] is also not proven that the men should raise them up to their ears, and the women up to their shoulders, rather as stated in the begining of this document, the prayer posture for women and men are the same.Touching the ear lobes is not taught by rasool (ﷺ) therefore we must avoid it.</span></p>

<h4>Hadith #66</h4><blockquote>Wa'il b. Hujr reported: 
<span style="color: blue;">He saw the Apostle of Allah(ﷺ) raising his hands at the time of beginning the prayer and reciting takbir, and according to Hammam (the narrator), the hands were lifted opposite to ears. He (the Holy Prophet(ﷺ) then wrapped his hands in his cloth and placed his "right hand over his left hand". And when he was about to bow down, he brought out his hands from the cloth, and then lifted them, and then recited takbir and bowed down, and when (he came back to the erect position) he recited: "Allah listened to him who praised Him." And when prostrates, he prostrated between the two palms.” </span>

<p style="color:blue;">
Some of our Muslim brothers following certain sects or madhabs (Maslaks) say that. <span style="color: red;">“Rafayden is not a confirmed Sunnah”</span> or that <span style="color: red;">“Rafayden should be left out”</span> or that <span style="color: red;"> “Rafayden is not to be done at all because it is not a sunnah”</span> and some of them even go to the extent of fabricating stories such as <span style="color: red;">“Prophet (ﷺ) commanded for rafa 'al yadain only in the early stages in order to avoid people from holding idols in their armpits during prayer”</span></p>

<p style="color:blue;">To Address the Above Accusations without further prolonging this, I'd say that all those narrations which negate rafayden have been declared severely weak or forged by the muhaditheen and some of the narrations given by our brothers to negate rafayaden , are often quoted out of context. The no. and volume of evidences from sahabis, tabain, tabe tabain, scholars and rasool (ﷺ) doing and teaching rafayden are so huge that there cannot be any doubt that rafayden IS a <b>CONFIRMED Sunnah.</b> Even Imam Bukhari (r.h) wrote an entire book refuting all those who negated rafayaden called Juzz al Rafayaden.</p>

<p style="color:blue;">However, since this is a matter of Fiqh, one cannot say that the one who avoids rafayden is a kaafir naudhubillah or a deviated muslim or that his salah is not valid for we have no authority to say such things to a Muslim brother. what can be said is that "the person is leaving out a confirmed sunnah of the prophet (a.s) and following the weak or rejected reports over what is assured and verified.”</p>

And i advice my brethren again not to weigh such Fiqhi matters equal to aqeeda/creed and go around insulting our hanafi brothers if they put down their knees first. The salah is valid irrespective if a Muslim does not do rafa al yadain or puts his knees down first for these are matters of sunnah. </p>

<p>
<b style="color:red;">Note:</b> <span style="color:blue;">The concept of raising the finger on saying “Laa Ilaaha” and putting it back down on saying “Illallah” is not proven from any hadeeth. It is taught by our great Scholars Like the Aaimah 'Arba and etc, but since it is not proven from any sahih hadeeth, we leave the doubtful matter and stick to the confirmed one. What is proven from the generality of ahadeeth is that we should make a ring and point (or move as you wish) with the index finger from the beginning of the tashahhud till the end (before Salaam). The Messenger of Allaah (ﷺ) once saw a man pointing with two fingers (in tashahhud), so he (ﷺ) said to him: “Ahhid Ahhid (Do it with one finger)” [Tirmidhi: 3557, and he said it’s Hasan, Nasaa’ee: 1273, Hadeeth Saheeh] This proves that we should keep our index finger up from the beginning of tashahhud till the end.</span>
</p>

<p><b>Conclusion:</b> <span style="color:red;">Hence Both views are permissible. i.e. One can either point his forefinger continuously (starting from attahiyatu lillahi..until the tasleem) throughought the sitting of entire tashahud or one canmove his forefinger continously throughout the entire tashahud until tasleem.</span></p>

<h4>Hadith #168</h4><blockquote>It was narrated from ‘Abdullah bin ‘Umar that: 
“<span style="color: blue;">He saw a man moving pebbles with his hand while praying. When he finished, ‘Abdullah said to him: “Do not move the pebbles while you are praying, for that is from Shaitan. Rather do what the Messenger of Allah (P.B.U.H) used to do.” He said: “What did he used to do?” He said: “He would put his right hand on his right thigh, and point with the finger that is next to the thumb toward the Qiblah, and he would look at it (forefinger), or thereabouts (or towards that region or area) ” Then he said: “This is what I saw the Messenger of Allah (P.B.U.H) doing.</span>”
